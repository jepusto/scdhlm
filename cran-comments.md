This is a re-submission. In this version I have:

* Miscellaneous bug fixes

## Test environments

* local Windows 7 Enterprise, R 3.3.1
* ubuntu 12.04.5 (on travis-ci), R 3.3.1

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs and no WARNINGs. 

There was 1 NOTE:

Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:

  All of the identified words are spelled correctly.
