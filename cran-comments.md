## Resubmission

This is a re-submission. In this version I have:

* Updated included functions to work with datasets instead of vectors only.
* Added features and fixed bugs in the included shiny app
* Added additional example datasets

## Test environments

* local Windows 7 Enterprise, R 3.6.1
* ubuntu 16.04.6 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.2
* win-builder (devel, release, oldrelease)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs and no WARNINGs. 

There was 1 NOTE:

Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Pustejovsky (9:29, 9:70)
  Shadish (9:46, 9:95)
  
  All of the identified words are spelled correctly.
