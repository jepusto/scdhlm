Title: Estimating Hierarchical Linear Models for Single-Case Designs
Version: 0.3.2
Authors@R: person("James", "Pustejovsky", email = "jepusto@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides a set of tools for estimating hierarchical linear
    models and effect sizes based on data from single-case designs. 
    Functions are provided for calculating standardized mean difference effect sizes that 
    are directly comparable to standardized mean differences estimated from between-subjects randomized experiments,
    as described in Hedges, Pustejovsky, and Shadish (2012) <DOI:10.1002/jrsm.1052>; 
    Hedges, Pustejovsky, and Shadish (2013) <DOI:10.1002/jrsm.1086>; and 
    Pustejovsky, Hedges, and Shadish (2014) <DOI:10.3102/1076998614547577>. 
    Includes an interactive web interface.
