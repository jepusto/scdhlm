Description: Provides a set of tools for estimating hierarchical linear
    models and effect sizes based on data from single-case designs. 
    Functions are provided for calculating standardized mean difference effect sizes that 
    are directly comparable to standardized mean differences estimated from between-subjects randomized experiments,
    as described in Hedges, Pustejovsky, and Shadish (2012) <DOI:10.1002/jrsm.1052>;

    Includes an interactive web interface.
