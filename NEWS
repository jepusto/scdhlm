scdhlm 0.4.2
=======================
* Imported g_mlm() from lmeInfo.
* Renamed scdhlm::extract_varcomp() to extract_varcomp_ex() which extracts variance components to be used for g_REML(). Imported lmeInfo::extract_varcomp() so that extract_varcomp() extracts variance components that can be used for g_mlm().
* Updated CI_() to allow calculating symmetric and asymmetric confidence intervals for g_HPS objects, g_REML objects, and g_mlm() objects. Note that symmetric confidence interval is the default.
* Updated vignette using g_mlm().
* Updated README using g_mlm().
* Updated shiny app using g_mlm().

scdhlm 0.3.2
=======================
* Updated HPS estimation functions to work with datasets (issue #2 from austinj).
* Added additional example datasets (Ruiz, Salazar, Thiemann2001, Thiemann2004, Bryant2018).
* Updated web-app to allow use of .xlsx files.
* Fixed bug in web-app occurring when cases were listed out of alphabetical order.
* Fixed bug in web-app occurring when auto-correlation is very weakly identified.

scdhlm 0.3.1
=======================
* Updated shiny app with additional documentation.
* Added additional example datasets (BartonArwood, Rodriguez, Romaniuk, AlberMorgan).

scdhlm 0.3
=======================
* Shiny app for calculating between-case standardized mean difference effect sizes.

scdhlm 0.2.2
=======================
* Bug fix in lme_AR1_cov_block_inv.
* Fixed bug in HPS effect size functions so that results are not dependent on order of data.

scdhlm 0.2.1
=======================
* Added vignette demonstrating use of g_REML.

scdhlm 0.2
=======================
* Initial release.
